Hey, Everyone this is my first project as beginner. So, basically I have created a website for a music compnay or we can say for label which contains certain pages such as the artist assocaited with the label, songs  and albums published by the label etc. 
In the middle of the development I faced some silly and some common issues such as creating extra content which is not even in the list of "TO DO". Also I struggled in position property which is a not so difficult to create for a beginner.
But, at end of discussion I have reached nowhere!!! XD
